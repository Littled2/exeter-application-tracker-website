        <h1>How to Write a Killer CV</h1>

        <div class="flex flex-col gap-s">
            <h2>1. Start with a Strong Opening</h2>
            <p>Kick off with a brief personal statement that captures who you are and what you bring to the table. Keep it focused and relevant to the role.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="flex flex-col gap-s">
            <h2>2. Tailor It to the Job</h2>
            <p>Adjust your CV for each application, highlighting the skills and experiences that match the job description. Use keywords the employer is looking for.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="flex flex-col gap-s">
            <h2>3. Show Your Impact</h2>
            <p>Instead of listing duties, focus on achievements. Use numbers to back up your successes, like “boosted sales by 15%” or “managed a team of five.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="flex flex-col gap-s">
            <h2>4. Keep It Simple and Clean</h2>
            <p>Use a clear, professional layout with easy-to-read fonts and enough white space. Make sure your CV is well-organized and visually appealing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="flex flex-col gap-s">
            <h2>5. Proofread</h2>
            <p>Double-check for typos and grammatical errors. A polished CV shows you care about details and professionalism.</p>
        </div>
