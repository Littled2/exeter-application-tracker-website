                <p>The Exeter Application Tracker started as a tool I built for myself whilst applying to placements.</p>
            
                <p>After attempting to track all my applications using a spreadsheet, my inner software engineer kicked in and I wanted to build a better solution. Initially developed as a simple tool to look cool and help me stay on top of my applications, I soon realised that I could deploy it to help out other students.</p>
            
                <p>Internships, placements, and grad schemes are so competitive that we have to apply to many for probability to work in our favour. Therefore, the Exeter Application Tracker is designed to work best when juggling many applications, and look awesome.</p>
