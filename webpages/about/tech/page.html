                <p>Designed around simplicity, ease of deployment and ease of development, I chose to use a React frontend and BaaS PocketBase backend.</p>

            <h2 class="text-white">Frontend</h2>
    
            <p>The frontend is a React SPA. For styling, I opted to use a selection of mini CSS libraries and conventions that I have developed myself previously. Functionally, it works a lot like Tailwind. Data is sent between the frontend and backend using the PocketBase SDK.</p>

            <p>The frontend uses a number of react libraries to aid various functions such as the deadline calendar. View all of the packages in use by checking out the project on GitHub.</p>

                <h2 class="text-white">Backend</h2>
    
                <p>To avoid spending hours writing API routes and managing all the necessary security, I chose to use a favorite backend-as-a-service of mine, PocketBase. PocketBase is a an absolutely brilliant project and offers a backend and SQLite Database hosted from a single executable file. While this could lead to scalability issues, thanks to its efficient design PocketBase is more than sufficient for the Exeter Application Tracker.</p>

                <h4 class="text-white">The Database</h4>
    
                <p>PocketBase uses a built-in SQLite database. The schema for which is displayed below:</p>
